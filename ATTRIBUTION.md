A lot of the workflow and schematics for the vehicle and the apartment floor are from the Gazebo tutorials [section](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials)

Specifically, the vehicle model workflow closely resembles the [Model Editor tutorial](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?cat=guided_b&tut=guided_b3) and the single floor apartment workflow closely resembles the [Building Editor tutorial](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?cat=build_world&tut=building_editor)
